[Constants in Kotlin -- what's a recommended way to create them? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44038721/constants-in-kotlin-whats-a-recommended-way-to-create-them)

**First of all**, the naming convention in Kotlin for constants is the same than in java (e.g : MY_CONST_IN_UPPERCASE).
## How should I create it?
## 1. As a top-level value (recommended)
You just have to put your const **outside** your class declaration.
**Two possibilities**: Declare your const in your class file (your const have a clear relation with your class)
```kotlin
private const val CONST_USED_BY_MY_CLASS = 1

class MyClass { 
    // I can use my const in my class body 
}
```
Create a dedicated constants.kt file where to store those global const (Here you want to use your const widely across your project):
```kotlin
package com.project.constants
const val URL_PATH = "https:/"
```
Then you just have to import it where you need it:
```kotlin
import com.project.constants

MyClass {
    private fun foo() {
        val url = URL_PATH
        System.out.print(url) // https://
    }
}
```
## 2. Declare it in a companion object (or an object declaration)
This is much **less** cleaner because under the hood, when bytecode is generated, a useless object is created: 
```kotlin
MyClass {
    companion object {
        private const val URL_PATH = "https://"
        const val PUBLIC_URL_PATH = "https://public" // Accessible in other project files via MyClass.PUBLIC_URL_PATH
    }
}
```
**Even worse** if you declare it as a val instead of a const (compiler will generate a useless object + a useless function):
```kotlin
MyClass {
    companion object {
        val URL_PATH = "https://"
    }
}
```
## Note :
In kotlin, const can just hold primitive types. If you want to assign it the result of calling a function, you need to add the @JvmField annotation. At compile time, it will be transform as a public static final variable. But it's slower than with a primitive type. Try to avoid it.
@JvmField val foo = Foo()
